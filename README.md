# Description:
  We have designed an asymmetric social media platform, Panameal. Panameal aims to provide users a way of sharing their stories of food. Users can post their experience, such as recipes and cooking procedures, on the platform. Users can also view other usersâ€™ posts and learn to cook new dishes from these posts.
